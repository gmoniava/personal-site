summary: "In this post I explain the structure of the movie app."
tags: ["software-development"]
---

Since my experience in front-end development is mostly with React, I recently
built a full-stack movie app using Next.js App Router and PostgreSQL to get
more comfortable with these technologies. The app lets you search,
add, edit, and delete movies, and supports authentication. It is open source.

This post serves as a companion to the source code, aiming to help you
understand the project by providing an overview of the project structure
along with explanations of various files and directories. If you’re
interested in a specific file, you can dive into the source code, which
also contains comments.

It’s assumed that you have a basic familiarity with the Next.js App
Router. If so, this post should be a helpful addition (together with the
source code) to help you understand how this project was implemented.

Below is the project structure with explanations. Feel free to expand
the folders you’re interested in.
