This post was inspired by my personal experience, but I later came across a concept
in psychology which was very related to it, maybe even the same,
it is called _core beliefs_, from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
I do not plan to explore that concept from CBT perspective (although there may be overlap),
I just wanted to share a small summary of my own reflections. If you’re interested in that concept,
you can look it up for more information.

Belief is basically acceptance that something is true with or without
proof. People may have beliefs about other people, the world, or
themselves. It is probably not too difficult to imagine the effect
beliefs can have on us. Let’s take examples of some beliefs:

- Someone believes that breaking a mirror brings bad luck.
- Someone believes that smoking is not actually bad for health.
- Someone believes that hard work always pays off.

Now let’s say we take a person who holds above beliefs. We can expect
that this person will not break too many mirrors in their life. Also we
can expect that in case they like smoking, they will be a smoker, because
there is nothing to deter them due to their belief. Finally, we can
also expect that they will be a hard worker.
So we can clearly see that beliefs have chance to affect our lives in significant
ways, depending on the beliefs we have, and degree to how much we belive in them.
We can also see that some beliefs may have negative results in our lives (e.g.,
the belief that smoking is not harmful) or positive results (e.g., the belief
about hard working always paying off).

Many of our beliefs are formed as a result of our experience. For
example, if someone breaks a promise to another person, that person may
think promises are meaningless.

Since the beliefs can have big impact on our lives, as we discussed above,
it is in our interests to ensure that they are not too far from reality.
We might need to put effort sometimes to convince ourselves that some
of our beliefs are only partly right or are totally wrong. This process might
be not easy sometimes because our ego does not like to be wrong - yet, it is
important that we engage in this process. For example, in one of our examples,
the person might need to convince themselves that not all promises are meaningless,
and that they shouldn't generalize based on the actions of just one or two people
who broke their promises.
