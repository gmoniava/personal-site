_This post was inspired by my personal experience, but I later came across a related concept in psychology called core beliefs, from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). I don’t plan to explore this topic from a CBT perspective (though there is likely some overlap). This post is mostly a summary of my own reflections. If you’re interested, you can look up core beliefs for more information._

## On Beliefs

Basically belief is something that you believe is true. People may have beliefs about other people, the world, or
themselves.

Let’s take examples of some beliefs:

- Someone believes that breaking a mirror brings bad luck.
- Someone believes that smoking is not actually bad for health.
- Someone believes that hard work always pays off.

Now let’s say we take a person who holds above beliefs. We can expect
that this person will try to not break too many mirrors in their life. Also we
can expect that in case they like smoking, they will be a smoker, because
there is nothing to deter them due to their belief. Finally, we can
also expect that they will be a hard worker.

So we can clearly see that beliefs have chance to affect our lives in significant
ways. The extent of their effect can vary depending on the: number of beliefs we have,
the content of beliefs, and the degree to how much we believe in them.

We can also see that some beliefs may have negative results in our lives (e.g.,
the belief that smoking is not harmful) or positive results (e.g., the belief
about hard working always paying off).

Also many of our beliefs are formed as a result of our experience. For
example, if someone breaks a promise to another person, that person may
think promises are meaningless.

Since beliefs can have big impact on our lives, it is in our interests that we stay open to revisiting them. This process
might not be easy sometimes because we may need to admit we were mistaken - yet, it is important that we engage in this process.
For example, in one of our earlier examples, the person might need to convince themselves that not all promises might be meaningless,
and that they shouldn't generalize based on the actions of just one or two people
who broke their promises.

## Why Changing Beliefs Can Be Difficult

As we discussed, it is often useful to revisit our beliefs and consider changing them. However, certain mental mechanisms can make this process more difficult.
Below I will try to list some of these mechanisms.

### Motivated Reasoning

When we evaluate new information and form opinions, we can do so with two different goals in mind: either to discover the truth or to confirm our desired conclusions. When the latter happens, it's called _motivated reasoning_. It’s worth noting that this process often occurs unconsciously. Let's look at some examples:

- If someone plans to go to a concert on Tuesday and develops a runny nose on Monday, they might tell themselves it’s just allergies or the weather — anything but the start of a cold or the flu. They don’t want to face the possibility that they might be getting sick and have to cancel, so they look for alternative explanations.

- Another example could be let's say a person supports a political candidate and that candidate is caught lying. The person might say "it’s just media exaggeration" instead of trying to find out if this was true. Since they do not want to change their opinion about their favourite candidate, they try to look for alternate explanations.

### Cognitive Dissonance

Cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort people feel when their beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors contradict each other. To reduce this discomfort, they often change their beliefs, justify their actions, or change the way they perceive the situation.

A classic example is from Leon Festinger’s study published in 1956, When Prophecy Fails, which explored how a small group of people responded when a deeply held prediction didn’t come true. The group, which believed a flood would destroy the world on a specific date, didn't abandon their belief when the event failed to occur. Instead, to reduce their discomfort, some members (mostly more committed ones) reasoned that their efforts had actually prevented the disaster.

### Conclusion

We have explored the role beliefs can play in one's life. We also saw some mechanisms (although it was not an exhaustive list) which can make changing our beliefs more difficult. Given this, it is important that we try to keep an open minded attitude.
