As a result of my interactions with doctors, I noticed that sometimes
I was given sub-optimal advice. I would like to mention few such examples,
which should highlight the need for us to be more informed about different conditions
as patients. This is especially true for third world countries, where quality
of healthcare is not as good.

## Exercise Stress Testing

There is such test in cardiology called stress test, where patient basically walks on a treadmill
that makes heart work progressively harder and an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors heart's electrical rhythms.
It is done is to detect a narrowing or blockage in one or more coronary arteries.
The idea is that when the heart works harder, the clogged vessel may not be able to handle the extra rush of blood needed by heart - and this should be detected by the test.
One of the reasons when this is done is if patients have chest pain.

I have done such test myself. And on one of the vists, cardiologist also mentioned I could have done it routinely
if I liked.

Now, here comes the problem. As far as I am concerned, routine stress tests are [not recommended](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/cardiac-exercise-stress-testing-what-it-can-and-cannot-tell-you)
already for more than a decade:

> The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel that makes recommendations to doctors, urges physicians not to routinely offer exercise stress testing to people without symptoms or strong risk factors for CAD. Physician groups like the American College of Cardiology support this recommendation.

One of the reasons likely is the following. Like we said stress testing can be helpful to detect blockage in one or more coronary arteries.
However, it detects those cases, when there is 70% or more blockage. Heart attacks on the other hand often happen when smaller blockages (less than 70%)
rupture and form a clot. So doing routine stress tests could give you a false sense of security. Now, I would like to point out that they are still useful
when someone has chest pain. Because the presence of chest pain suggests that there is likely a significant blockage in the arteries, and in that context, a stress test is more likely to detect it

Another reason why doing unneeded stress can be harmful is that this test (like many tests) can give false positives (this happens roughly in 10% of cases).
When this test gives false positive result, patient usually has to perform an invasive procedure called Coronarography, which comes with its own risks.

## Gallbladder Polyps

Another case was when I had to repeat abdominal scan for a gallbladder polyp. I was interested in certain features of the polyp,
however I found out the person performing the scan was not willing or able to assess those features. Anyway they mentioned
that if there is a polyp I should consider a cholecystectomy (removal of galdbladder). Now usually the doctor performing the scan
is not the one to recommend treatment, but I am mentioning this case, because they voiced their opinion anyway.
Now I told them that polyps of size less than 4mm are considered very low risk and cholecystectomy is not advised in those cases based
on the latest guidelines (unless there are some other risk factors) - on which he responded that size did not matter that much and
in a way seemed to have distrust in the guidelines.

## Final Thoughts

To sum up, while being informed is important, we should not try to ignore doctor's advice, rather it may be more wise to discuss with them
any issues or concerns that arise.
