## The Problem

2024 Stack Overflow
[survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/developer-profile#2-online-resources-to-learn-how-to-code)
listed _technical documentation_ and _written tutorials_ as two of the top three resources for learning to code.

Despite this I’m sure you’ve experienced (likely more than once) that
frustrating moment when you finish reading a tutorial or documentation
and feel even more confused than when you started.

This can be a serious problem because poor documentation and tutorials can
discourage developers from learning or adopting a certain technology.

## Evidence

Actually in 2017, GitHub's Open Source
[Survey](https://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/#insights) showed "incomplete
or confusing documentation" to be the top pain point. I doubt the
situation has significantly changed since then, at least judging from my
personal experience and experience of others with whom I have
interacted.

## Possible Cause and Solutions

One possible cause, in my opinion, is that we as developers need to
realize that writing is a _separate skill_ and it needs to be worked on to
be improved.

You can be an excellent coder but still struggle to explain your ideas
clearly in writing. So if we, as developers, work a bit on this skill,
maybe we can improve the situation a little bit.

For example in academia, it's well understood that being an expert in a
subject doesn't automatically make someone a good teacher. The same
principle applies here.

Organizations can also help improve the situation by:

- regularly gathering feedback from developers who use the organization's documentation, and making improvements accordingly.
- adding technical writers to support documentation efforts.
- paying more attention to documentation related issues on GitHub repositories, which, in my experience, are sometimes overlooked.
