I created this blog using [Portfolio Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) from Vercel.
The main functionality I added to it which it did not have was filtering of the posts and theme
switcher. The posts themselves are written using MDX and stored on the
file system.

The main structure of the blog is you have a server component
(`app/components/server/posts/index.tsx`) which retrieves the posts and
passes them as props to the client component
(`app/components/client/posts.tsx`) which shows the posts.

## Initial server-side filtering approach

Initially, I implemented filtering on the server side. The server
component would filter the blog posts based on the URL search parameters
and forward the filtered results to the client component. The user could
update the filter values using a multi-select component, which would
update the URL with the new filter values. This triggered a re-render of
the server component, which would then filter the posts again using the
updated query parameters and pass the filtered results to the client.

## Why I switched to client side filtering

However, I realized that this approach could potentially cause server multiple
function invocations whenever the user interacted with the filters (each
time a filter changed, the server would have to perform filtering).
While this is usually fine, depending on your hosting plan, you might
want to limit the number of server function invocations.

To address this, I refactored the client component to handle filtering
locally using React state. In this updated version, the server component
simply retrieves all blog posts and sends them to the client (the posts
being sent are reduced in size — they don’t include the full post
content — since we are just using them to generate links). This allows
the server component to be statically generated, avoiding server
function calls when the user filters posts.

## Keeping URL parameters in sync

Even though filtering now happens on the client side, I still wanted the
URL parameters and the local filter state to stay in sync.

I decided to use native history API (`pushState`) to push new filter values to the URL,
instead of using `router.push` from `next/navigation`.
The reasons for this mainly was that `router.push` causes react to wait on a server
round trip before it can update the page.

## Sitemap and RSS

The started kit also has a app/sitemap.ts file (which is basically a
special Route Handler) and route handler (app/rss/route.ts) for
generating RSS. Both were relying on usage of the method to retrieve
blog posts from the file system. Again, with the goal to reduce function
invocations, I added bellow line in both files:

`export const dynamic = "force-static";`

## Adding theme switcher

I also added theme switcher to my blog. The starter kit already had
theme support in the sense that it was using tailwind classes like
dark:text-white. But it did not have the ability to manually switch
between themes. For this, I used the next-themes library, which takes
care of many common theme management tasks such as persisting the
selected theme in local storage, applying the appropriate dark or light
class to the HTML element, etc. The relevant implementation can be found
in theme-toggle.tsx client component.

Also, I would like to note that, the starter kit comes with packages
tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/postcss both had version 4.0.0-alpha.13. I
had to upgrade them to versions 4.1.8 otherwise the themes were not
working.

## Final notes

Feel free to explore the source code of this blog. I’ve also added
comments in the code to make it easier to follow the implementation. If
you're interested in the server-side filtering approach, check out the
